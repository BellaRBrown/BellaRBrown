                <p>Let&#39;s face it nobody likes frustrating schoolwork, the kind that stresses you out and makes you want to quit. But I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s better to persist through your problems. The communicable disease project was a big problem.
                    You make one error and our entire poster would be off, you measure wrong, you have to draw it all again. You draw a not straight line you&#39;d have to go back and redraw it. It made you want to just sloppily draw everything and be
                    done with it with no craftsmanship. I&#39;ve improved in craftsmanship because I&#39;ve grown in the quality of persistence.
                </p>

                <p>One of the best projects that shows how much I&#39;ve grown in persistence, which helped me become better at craftsmanship, is the communicable diseases project. We had to create a poster explaining 4 chosen communicable diseases. The
                    goal of the project was to create a fun interesting poster to inform people about communicable diseases. My partner and I chose cryptosporidium, listeriosis, salmonella, and E-coli. We had to research a bunch of information to put
                    on the poster. This project was in wellness and math class. For math class we had to design a tessellated shape to put the information in. tessellated means covered by a single shape repeated with no gaps or overlaps. Tessellations
                    are hard to come up with and, I think my second draft shows how I persisted and came up with something even though it was very frustrating. It took a lot of time and persistence to complete the poster. Many times we got measurements
                    wrong or an angle was off by 1&deg;. A lot of shapes we had to redraw. One of the triangles was a different distance from the center so we had to erase it and draw it all again. Another requirement was that our design not only had
                    to have a tessellation, it also had to be symmetric as a whole. Symmetry means that you could fold it in half and both sides are exactly the same. Because of all these problems my partner and I didn&#39;t want to work, we just wanted
                    it all to work out. I think our final draft shows how we decided to persist and finish the project.</p>

                <p>This year I&#39;ve grown in the quality of persistence which has helped me to become better at craftsmanship. Even though I struggled a lot, I realized I couldn&#39;t give up and even though it was hard I still needed to make it look nice.
                    I would never have been able to do that if I wasn&#39;t able to persist through my problems. It&#39;s especially important that I grew in this quality at this time in life because the projects are only getting harder, and if I give
                    up at this level of project then I&#39;ll never be able to do any harder projects. If I just give up when things get hard then I never will be able to get good grades in later grades. More than that though, the ability to persist has
                    allowed me to become better at craftsmanship, which means that my projects will look nice and professional.</p>
